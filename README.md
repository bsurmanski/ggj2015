# Who Ate My Cookies?

## For Global Game Jam 2015

This game was created in 48 hours for the *Global Game Jam 2015* event. The game
was written by Brandon Surmanski in the OWL programming language, an
experimental programming language also written by Brandon Surmanski.

### About
*Global Game Jam* is an annual event where participants create a game based on a
theme in under 48 hours. This year's theme was "What do we do now?". I decided
to interpret the theme as: "Someone ate all of your cookies; you are hungry;
what do we do now? Eat everything else".

#### Gameplay
*Who Ate My Cookies* is a silly game about eating everything in your house. You
may eat creatures smaller than you. Watch out, large creatures will try to eat
you too! Eat everything in the house to fill your belly!

#### Controls

* Arrow Keys to move
* space to start

##### Other Controls

* ESC to exit
* X for crazy mode (cosmetic only)
* Z for a calm screen


#### Programming Language
This game was written in the OWL programming language, the compiler can be found
[here](https://github.com/bsurmanski/wlc). The OWL programming language is an experiment
by me, Brandon Surmanski, to create a modern object-oriented programming
language without a garbage collector. The *Global Game Jam* event provided an
opportunity to try out the current set of features of the OWL programming
language, while testing the compiler for bugs.

OWL is fully object oriented language with reference counted objects, implicit
interfaces, sized arrays, tuples, function overloading and more. For more
information, view the compiler github page
[here](https://github.com/bsurmanski/wlc).
